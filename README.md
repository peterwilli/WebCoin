# WebCoin
Weekend tryout making own PoSV-based coin with no transaction history

# How to run the dev version
This guide assumes you have NodeJS installed (see:https://nodejs.org/en)

- clone this project
- `cd` to the project and run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` and wait for the window to pop up
- you can run an additional peer by running `npm run peer` in another terminal (from the project directory)

There is a test wallet file int he pre-pro directory that you can open to get 1 million WebCoins to try out while it's alpha :)
